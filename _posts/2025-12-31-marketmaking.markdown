Every time you buy a stock, someone sells it to you. Every time you sell, someone buys. Have you ever considered that odd? That there is always a person on the other side of your trade willing to buy 100 shares of Samsung on a random Tuesday? The chances that another human happened to want exactly 100 shares of Samsung at exactly 2PM at exactly your price are effectively zero. So who's on the other side? .... Some entity that "makes" the market. These market makers' entire business model is being available at that exact moment, ready to take the opposite side of your trade. The infrastructure that makes trading feel effortless is itself a very sophisticated business! 

Thus a market maker is motivated by investors want immediacy to trade now at an exchange but don't want to wait for a natural counterparty who wants to take the exact opposite position at the exact same time. Market makers bridge this timing mismatch by stepping in as the temporary counterparty. They are distinct from entities that express views on the market and earn money by taking directional bets; market makers earn money by continuously offering to take on risks of taking on the opposite side of your trade. They profit from the bid-ask spread \(the difference between the price they'll buy at and the price they'll sell at\)while managing the risk that the securities they're holding move against them. 

The actual mechanics of "providing liquidity" are more nuanced than simply posting prices, and grasping this mechanism offers a peek at the machinery beneath our increasingly electronic markets. For anyone trading ETFs, options, or less liquid securities, market makers operate undercover and directly impact the very prices one pays and receives—making their operations relevant beyond academic interest. Below are 7 different things I've found essential to understanding what they do.

1. ETFs have two linked markets operating at the same time. The market visible to us is the exchange where ETF shares trade like stocks. The invisible market is the primary market, where large institutions called authorized participants can swap ETF shares with the underlying basket of securities. The swap is called a creation / redemption process, and is the reason why ETFs can track what they are holding. 

2. The fact that ETFs have two markets matters to anyone who’s ever traded an ETF because the price of an ETF is impacted by the “accuracy” of this process. The ETF price should be the value of its holdings, but the ETF can have multiple prices. (1) NAV price is the accounting value of the holding calculated after the close. (2) Intraday fair value is a running estimate done by desks based on live pricings of the holdings. (3) market price is the price where buyers and sellers meet on the exchange. This can drift due to supply and demand as well as liquidity conditions, hedging costs, etc. Thus an ETF can trade slightly richer or cheaper compared to its underlying price. 

3. Well then how are market participants guaranteed that the price of the ETF is tracking its underlyings correctly? If the ETF trades above its underlying value, a large participant can buy the underlying, deliver it to the ETF issuer, receive newly created ETF shares, and sell those shares at a higher market price. Such selling pressure pulls down the price. If the ETF trades below its underlying value, vice versa. The large participant can again buy ETF shares cheaply, redeem them with issuer for the underlying basket, sell the underlying. The reduced ETF supply should lift up the price. Such large participants that do this are called market makers. 

4. It might seem like market makers earn the spread risk free. However earning such spreads involves tradeoffs for a market maker such as: movement of prices when the market maker is holding the inventory; paying borrowing and financing costs. 

5. How can a market maker sell an ETF they do not own? Since a market maker quote two sided markets all day, it might end up short because clients are lifting offers. Then the market maker has to make delivery of securities that they have promised. If a mm is short and needs shares, it locates borrow through a securities lending channel, post collateral such as cash and government securities and pay a borrow fee. Since the lender might want the shares back, the mm has to consider recall risks. Thus quoting is not only pricing for mms. The guarantee is needed that mm can clear, borrow, hedge, and settle what it has promised. 

6. Time is not a mere backdrop but becomes the most important variable in market making. When a firm runs an integrated book across related products like an ETF, its underlying stocks, and associated futures, intraday exposures that appear risky in the morning can net to flat by the afternoon because the creation/redemption process completed. Their edge lies in being willing to hold inventory in the intervening hours while other participants demand immediate execution, thus are paid for bearing time risk. 

7. A key competence for a market making firm, a lot of the times, comes from infrastructure that allows firms to shave of microseconds of transaction time. In markets where opportunities exist only for a blink of an eye, microsecond data is the prerequisite for pricing to hedging, and and physical server proximity to exchanges' data centers has become a competitive necessity. Market making firms pay substantial fees to "co-locate" their servers inside the same data centers where exchanges operate, placing their hardware within feet of the exchange's matching engines. The New York Stock Exchange's data center in Mahwah, New Jersey, hosts hundreds of firms in this arrangement. Similarly, the CME Group operates a massive co-location facility in Aurora, Illinois (about 40 miles west of Chicago), where firms running strategies in futures and options pay premium rates for rack space and direct connectivity to the exchange's servers. Nasdaq's data center in Carteret, New Jersey, serves the same purpose for Nasdaq-listed securities. The lengths firms go to minimize latency borders on the extreme. When the NYSE moved its operations from Manhattan to Mahwah in 2010, some high-frequency trading firms laid dedicated fiber optic cables along the most geographically direct routes between data centers—avoiding existing telecom infrastructure that might add milliseconds through unnecessary routing. Michael Lewis's "Flash Boys" chronicled how one firm spent millions to lay an 827-mile fiber line from Chicago to New Jersey that was straighter than existing paths. Others have deployed microwave networks between exchanges because radio waves through air travel faster than light through fiber optic cable. In modern market making in markets saturated by other firms trying to market make for the same securiites, competitive advantage increasingly derives infrastructure.
